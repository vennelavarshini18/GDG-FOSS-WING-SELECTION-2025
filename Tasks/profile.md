**Why do you want to join GDG FOSS Wing?**: 

I would like to be honest, I am still a beginner in open source. I started exploring this aspect a little late, so I may not have many achievements here right now. So I see this as an oppurtunity to do something big eventually by learning and exploring open source contribution more.

And I personally want to teach and encourage my juniors or peers on things what I know and deepen my skills in the things that I lack. Joining this wing feels like the right environment to build that.


**Any other wing(s) you have applie to?**:

I am applying for ML wing along with Foss wing.

* Priority order: 1. Foss wing  2. ML wing.


**Are you interested in participating in any of the global open-source programs like GSoC, LFX, Outreachy, SOB etc? If yes, mention it**:

Yes, I am very much interested in participating in global open source projects. My primary goal is to try my best for GSoC, where I would like to contribute in repositories from organisations like KubeFlow, Python Software Foundation, CloudCV or JinaAI (related to python, python web).

I also want to explore OutReachy, since it provides great opputunity for women in tech. I want to work on impactful open-source projects while learning from experienced mentors from diverse communities.


**Anything else you would like to share (Links, projects, PRs or something else) with us?**:
* Actively Contributing in GSSoC'25 in Data Science and ML related repositories. Opened 3 PR's in a Data science repository as part Gssoc'25 (creating clean python web interfaces for existing models, LSTM trained using PyTorch) - MERGED and 2 PR's in Gssoc'25 - YET TO BE REVIEWED (opened PR's recently)

* Secured 3rd place (415 points) in Foss Weekend IIIT Lucknow, where my major contributions are in Classification and Regression repositories.

* Wrote some technical blogs on my interests,
    1.* LANGCHAIN'S OOPS MOMENT : (https://medium.com/@vennelavarshini07/langchains-oops-moment-story-behind-langchain-runnables-2f7de780356a) 
    2.* POSITIONAL ENCODINGS - HIDDEN SUPERPOWER OF TRANSFORMERS : (https://medium.com/@vennelavarshini07/the-hidden-superpower-of-transformers-positional-encodings-1c9bee4f739c)

* Worked on end to end projects. Here are few personal projects:
   1. Aurora : LINK(https://github.com/vennelavarshini18/AURORA)
   2. ML Notes Helper : LINK(https://github.com/vennelavarshini18/ML_Notes_Helper)
   3. Query Clone Detector : LINK(https://github.com/vennelavarshini18/QueryClone-Detector)
   For other small projects, please check my Github.

* Community contribution in Kaggle(shared many datasets, my notebook works of ML(over 80), participated in competitions and participated in discussions. Many being helpful for data science enthusiasts acted as beginner guides and got upvotes too)- LINK(https://www.kaggle.com/vennela18).

* I and my team are also shortlisted for participating in ETHDelhi, where we work on DL+Blockchain project. a platform that rewards people for eco friendly actions by giving carbon credits.
